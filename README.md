# MoldGui

Identify diagnostic nucleotide combinations (DNCs) in DNA sequence alignments, which can be used to provide formal diagnoses of these taxa. This is in the form of "redundant DNC‚Äù (rDNC), which takes into account unsampled genetic diversity.

This is a Qt GUI for [Mold v1.4](https://github.com/SashaFedosov/MolD).


## Windows executable
Download and run the standalone executable without installing Python.<br>
[See the latest release here.](https://github.com/iTaxoTools/MolDGui/releases/latest)


## Manual
You can read more about MolD and how to use it in the manual.<br>
